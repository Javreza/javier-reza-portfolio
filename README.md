**I KNOW I WENT OFFSCRIPT BUT PLEASE GIVE ME AN A!**

For this project, the skeletal structure for my portfolio was set. This will serve as the foundation to my portfolio
in the future, I plan to build on top of it as I progress through my program; and I learn more techniques. I tried to add some sort of functionality, other than links, by hiding and unhiding elements using pseudoclasses. My efforts on that front were in vain, however.

The pseudoclasses were going to be used to open and close "windows", that didnt pan out as expected.
An example of how I tried to implement the pseudoclasses is as follows:

.projects {
visibility:hidden;
}

.projects-button:active + .projects {
 visibility: visible;
}

Due to not being able to implement what I pictured, the deployed website will look as follows:

It was intended for the opening of the page to look like so:

It seems that the website seems stable regardless of the state of either "window".

Here's the projects window being able to function independent of the about window.

And here the about window being able to be visible without the projects window.
